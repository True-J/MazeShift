# MazeShift
The goal is to create a game where players move through a maze looking for room 44.
The maze will contain different puzzles to help players solve the maze.

(10/7/20) I am trying to figure out how to make the maze shift when players enter certain rooms. (Done)

(10/9/20) I've updated the Maze. So now all the rooms work. Instead of using a mathematical formula, I just thought it'd be easier
to store all of the room connections in an array. So now, there is an array that holds the maze map, the rooms and which map they
match to, and the hallways between all the rooms on each level. My next step is to figure out what happens when the player reaches the end
of the maze. I also want to change the 5 extra room names so that they don't show up on the buttons like a normal room. After that, 
I can start adding puzzles into the maze.
